\chapter*{Abstract}
The thesis concerns the problem of moral decision making in self-driving cars. I examine some of the key philosophical issues involved in programming cars to make moral decisions and propose crowdsourced morality as a solution. I begin by surveying the problems inherent in this approach and explore random sampling as a possible solution. Finally, I conclude by suggesting further research avenues in this area.
